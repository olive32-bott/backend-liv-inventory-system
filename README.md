Inventory Management System (Console App)

This is a simple console app I built in C# to manage products in stock.
It lets you:
- Add new products
- Update product info
- Delete products
- View all products
- Search for products


## How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
git clone https://github.com/olive32-bott/backend-liv-inventory-system.git
